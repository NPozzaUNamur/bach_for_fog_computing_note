Exists extension of linda to handle several tuple space [[tuple-based_coordination_in_large-scale_situated_systems.pdf#page=5&selection=31,12,31,37&color=yellow|tuple-based_coordination_in_large-scale_situated_systems, p.5]]

Exists extension for network-oriented in Linda [[tuple-based_coordination_in_large-scale_situated_systems.pdf#page=5&selection=60,0,65,38&color=yellow|tuple-based_coordination_in_large-scale_situated_systems, p.5]]

Distributed Linda extension that use MANETs (not really IoT but more P2P computational division) [[tuple-based_coordination_in_large-scale_situated_systems.pdf#page=5&selection=87,0,89,45&color=yellow|tuple-based_coordination_in_large-scale_situated_systems, p.5]]

*Spatial Tuple* is a spacial based coordination model [[tuple-based_coordination_in_large-scale_situated_systems.pdf#page=6&selection=33,0,36,17&color=yellow|tuple-based_coordination_in_large-scale_situated_systems, p.6]]
Use decoration to specify the space point of a tuple [[tuple-based_coordination_in_large-scale_situated_systems.pdf#page=6&selection=36,35,36,75&color=yellow|tuple-based_coordination_in_large-scale_situated_systems, p.6]]

*Syntaxe of spacial primitives* : \<op\>(\<Tuple\> @ \<Region\>) [[tuple-based_coordination_in_large-scale_situated_systems.pdf#page=6&selection=74,0,74,10&color=yellow|tuple-based_coordination_in_large-scale_situated_systems, p.6]]

*Predefined syntaxe*: [[tuple-based_coordination_in_large-scale_situated_systems.pdf#page=6&annotation=566R|tuple-based_coordination_in_large-scale_situated_systems, p.6]]
- `t @ here`:  Place the tuple in tuple space where process is running
- `t @ me`: Bind the Tuple to the process (that means that if process moved, the tuple moves too)

There is a space concern for tuple based coordination. Model should handle association between space location and node [[tuple-based_coordination_in_large-scale_situated_systems.pdf#page=7&selection=22,23,24,42&color=yellow|tuple-based_coordination_in_large-scale_situated_systems, p.7]]

There is a notion a time, but I don't understand [[tuple-based_coordination_in_large-scale_situated_systems.pdf#page=7&selection=26,2,26,6&color=yellow|tuple-based_coordination_in_large-scale_situated_systems, p.7]]

The author's model aims to be heterogeneous. So that it can fit with client-server architecture. [[tuple-based_coordination_in_large-scale_situated_systems.pdf#page=7&selection=58,2,58,28&color=yellow|tuple-based_coordination_in_large-scale_situated_systems, p.7]]

Define space-time model:
