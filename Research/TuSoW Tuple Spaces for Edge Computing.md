[[TuSoW Tuple Spaces for Edge Computing]]
# Summary
This article presents a architecture to allow distributed tuple space. It brings commun interface that has to be supported, as well as some API technologie support.
It is based on Coord-aaS. 
# Notes
The decoupling between data and producer allow an better robustness [[TuSoW_Tuple_Spaces_for_Edge_Computing.pdf#page=2&selection=140,32,143,10&color=yellow|TuSoW_Tuple_Spaces_for_Edge_Computing, p.2]]

Delegation of computations allow scalability and load balancing. [[TuSoW_Tuple_Spaces_for_Edge_Computing.pdf#page=2&selection=149,10,153,18&color=yellow|TuSoW_Tuple_Spaces_for_Edge_Computing, p.2]]

TuSoW uses REST [[TuSoW_Tuple_Spaces_for_Edge_Computing.pdf#page=2&selection=236,0,236,27&color=yellow|TuSoW_Tuple_Spaces_for_Edge_Computing, p.2]]
